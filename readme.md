# Music Theory Charts for Piano: Interactive Visualizer for Practicing Music Theory
## Intro
A small webapp to streamline piano practice. The reactive interface displays scales for all 12 standard notes found in Western music. Frontend is still in development, but two views will be added soon:
- Scale view: Choose a scale and view it starting from all 12 notes, side by side.
- Key view: Choose a starting note and view all available scales next to each other.

## Installation
The coreÂ logic is written in TypeScript under ```/src```. These files can be compiled into JavaScript using ```tsc```.
It is possible to run the project using ```live-server```. To install ```live-server``` using npm, run ```npm install -g live-server```.

## Usage
Navigate to the repository directory and run ```live-server``` on the command line. If everything went well, you should see a line like this in your terminal:

```Serving ".../MusicTheoryCharts" at [IP_ADDRESS]```

If the interface hasn't opened automatically, navigate to ```IP_ADDRESS``` on your favorite browser.
